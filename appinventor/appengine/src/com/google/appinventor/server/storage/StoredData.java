 * Classes for the data objects that are stored in the Objectify database.

 * TODO(user): for now I just defined a bunch of classes (parallel
 * to the ones in the old ode.proto). It might be
 * worth considering whether to make these classes extend DAOBasic (does it buy
 * us anything) and whether to add any methods for manipulating the objects.
 *
 * TODO(user): consider separating these out into individual class
 * files - more Java-y?
